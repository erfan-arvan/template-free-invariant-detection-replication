/**
 * Test-based invariant filtering that removes invariants causing test failures.
 *
 * <p>Strategy: failures are caught <em>online</em>, as a run's output streams, starting from the
 * very first run of the suite — not discovered after the fact by scanning a completed log. The
 * caller (see {@code App}'s main recovery loop) watches every run in real time for any recognized
 * {@link TestFailureLogParser} signature and kills the process the instant one appears; if that
 * happened, the already-known failure is passed in directly via {@code preKnownFailure} and this
 * method skips straight to isolating its cause. Only when no failure was ever caught live (e.g. the
 * caller doesn't watch, or a failure format slips through undetected until the run's natural exit)
 * does this method fall back to the old post-hoc path: exit code first, and only if non-zero,
 * scanning the completed log once for a recognized signature.
 *
 * <p>If a failure is confirmed, the candidate pool of invariants to search over is seeded directly
 * from what already executed — from the initial run's shm directory when the failure was caught
 * online mid-run (the most reliable source, since a killed process never gets to run its normal
 * shutdown-hook log sidecar), or otherwise from the completed initial run's log (every {@code
 * INV_EXD} entry) — <em>not</em> by rerunning the whole suite again, since that run already paid
 * the cost of executing everything up to that point and already recorded the result.
 *
 * <p>From there, <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/DeltaDebugger.html">delta
 * debugging</a> ({@code ddmin}) isolates a 1-minimal culprit set: candidates are disabled/enabled
 * in shrinking, targeted subsets, each checked with a real-time monitored rerun directly against
 * {@code injectedProjectRoot}'s own already-built working directory — the same directory the main
 * pipeline's own recovery loop reuses across its iterations — with which invariants are active
 * driven purely at runtime via {@code DP_DISABLED_FILE} ({@code oca.DpRuntime.DISABLED}),
 * never by editing source. A previous version of this class cloned a fresh, disposable copy of the
 * project and commented invariant blocks out of its source for every single trial; that guaranteed
 * every trial re-paid a full, cold recompile from scratch, which is exactly the condition under
 * which the main pipeline's own first two recovery iterations also stalled — its third iteration
 * only got past that same stall because it reused an already-compiled, warm build. Disabling via
 * {@code DP_DISABLED_FILE} only ever removes an invariant check from running — it can never
 * introduce new behavior — so reusing one warm working directory across every trial is safe, and
 * lets every trial run under the same warm conditions the main pipeline's recovery loop enjoys
 * instead of always repeating its first, cold attempt. As the runner's output streams in, each line
 * is checked against the same failure signature, and the instant the <em>same</em> failure (see
 * {@link TestFailureLogParser#isSameFailure}) reappears, the process is killed immediately rather
 * than waiting for the rest of the trial's suite run to finish.
 *
 * <p>Before trusting that search, each failure is sanity-checked: disabling <em>every</em>
 * candidate invariant must actually make it stop reproducing. If it doesn't — e.g. a build/lint
 * failure (a Checkstyle rule, say) that no invariant's enabled/disabled state could ever affect —
 * the failure isn't attributable to any invariant, and the search for it stops rather than
 * pretending {@code ddmin} found a meaningful minimal set.
 *
 * <p>A project can have more than one distinct failing test. After isolating and disabling one
 * failure's culprit set, the suite is rerun once more; if a <em>different</em> recognized failure
 * shows up, the whole process repeats for it — seeding a fresh candidate pool, sanity-checking, and
 * running {@code ddmin} again — continuing until a rerun shows no more recognized failures, a
 * failure turns out not to be attributable, or a safety cap on rounds is hit.
 *
 * <p>Every trial and confirming rerun above executes directly against {@code injectedProjectRoot};
 * none of them ever edit its source. Only the final result (see {@link Result#finalProjectRoot}) is
 * built as a fresh copy with the isolated culprit set's marker-based regions actually commented out
 * of the source, once, at the very end.

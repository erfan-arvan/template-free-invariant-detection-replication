        Before producing the JSON, think internally about:
        1) Which names are in-scope and their types.
        2) Which expressions are evaluable safely (add null checks only when required).
        3) What constraints are directly implied by the provided PROGRAM CONTEXT.
        4) Prefer simple relations between parameters, fields, and result and safe pure method calls.

        Within this single response, create three internal drafts with different focuses:
        - Draft A: focus on simple parameter/field constraints.
        - Draft B: focus on relations involving 'result' (if METHOD_EXIT) and parameters.
        - Draft C: focus on safe, pure method-call predicates (if any are implied by context).

        Then keep only invariants that appear in at least two drafts, or are clearly implied by context and non-redundant.
        Return ONLY the final agreed JSON. Do not output the drafts.
